## React.js Assignment

Dear InfoTrack team, Kindly refer to the steps below to install the dependencies and the scripts to run, bnuild, test the application.

I have used material UI for almost all of the styled components
React query was used as an api fetching library

For the table components I have used https://fakestoreapi.com as the baseURL for some table data

For the markers in the map and analytics data in the cards I have used a MOCK_DATA.json file which consists of markers to be displayed in the map.


Note: 

1. Kindly rename the .env.example file to .env and enter your google maps api key. 
2. This code can still be improved with the best practices, more test cases scenarios and modularize some of the components. 

## Installation

To install dependencies you can run:

### `npm install`


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
